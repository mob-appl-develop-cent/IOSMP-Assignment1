**Simple Calculator App**


**Overview:** Using Xcode, the latest version of iOS SDK and the Swift programming language, create a
simple calculator app that allows the user to add, subtract, multiply and divide. The app should have the
number keys (0 to 9), a reset button, the decimal button (.), and an equals (=) button. Calculations will
be displayed in a UILabel or other Suitable View Control.
